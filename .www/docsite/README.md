# docsite

The `docsite` project is the official documentation site for `torque`

[lbft.dev](https://www.lbft.dev/)

This project is meant to dogfood the `torque` framework and showcase many of its features and provide examples of useful patterns.

The application is built into a Docker container and hosted on DigitalOcean's App Platform and is deployed automatically on every push to the `master` branch.
